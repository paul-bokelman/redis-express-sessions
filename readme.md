# Session management with Redis and Express

Basic session with redis as the session storage and express as the web server. Built for scalability.

### How to run the application

1. Clone the repository
2. Open root directory in your terminal and run `npm install` - this will install all the dependencies.
3. In the root directory run `npm run dev` - this will start the server.
4. Make requests to http://localhost:3220 in [postman](https://www.postman.com/).

You can make postman act as a browser by using [postman interceptor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo?hl=en), this will allow postman to store cookies set by the server.
